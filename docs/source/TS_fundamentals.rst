Fundamentals of Thomson Scattering 
==========================================

This page provides some basics on Thomson scatering to help users figure out how to modify the input deck. 

Key Concepts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Thomson scattering** is a diagnostic technique used to obtain information about the plasma conditions such as temperature and density.

**Langmuir waves**, also known as **Electron Plasma Waves (EPW)**, are high frequency electrostatic waves in a plasma with electrons as the oscillating species.

**Ion Acoustic Waves (IAW)** are low frequency electrostatic waves in a plasma, with ions as the primary oscillating species. 
In this case the electrons fight to sustain charge neutrality.

**Scattering angle** is the angle between the incident and scattered  electromagnetic wave.

Light scattered off of plasma waves experience **Doppler shifts** due to the velocity of electrons relative to the incoming light. 
These shifts provide insights into the movemet of electrons and characteristics of the plasma waves. 

Fit and data plot for EPW

**Electron temperature (Te)**  as defined througth the averarge kinetic energy.

**Electron density (ne)** is the number of free electrons per unit volume,and it is used to characterize the plasma.

**m** is the super-Gaussian order of the electron velocity distribution function

**amp1** is the blue-shifted EPW amplitude multiplier.

**amp2** is the red-shifted EPW amplitude multiplier.

**Lineouts** are locations where data will be analyzed. 

**Lineout start** specifies the first location where a lineout will be take

**lineout end** specifies the last location where a lineout will be taken

**Red** and **blue**,  **min** and **max** are the start and end of the region where the shifts will be analyzed.

**Ion tempreature (Ti)** the ion temperature as defined through the average kinetic energy.

**Z** is the average ionization state. 

**Va** is the plasma flow velocity.

**lam** is the probe wavelenght. 

**ud** is the electron drfit velocity. 

**amp3** is the IAW amplitude multiplier.

**IAW max & min** designate the starting and ending wavelenghts for the analysis of the IAW.

**IAW cf min & max** indicate the starting and ending wavelenghts for a central feature to be excluded from analysis.
