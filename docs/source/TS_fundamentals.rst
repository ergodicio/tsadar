Fundamentals of Thomson Scattering 
==========================================

This page will provide 
To talk about Thomson Scattering, we firts need to talk about plasma. So, what is Plasma?

**Plasma** is a an ionized gas, which is mande up of a collection of free electrons and positively charged ions.

**What is Thomson Scattering?** 
thomson scattering is a technique used in plasma diagnostics to obtain information about the energy and temperature of the ions and electrons, as well as flcutuations in plasma conditions.

**Plasma parameter** characterizes the effects of different interactions like thermal motions and electromagnetic fields affect the plasma. It is unitless.

**Electrostatic Waves** (I am confused, when charged particles move in a plasma they create electric fields. but the particles also move as an effect of these fields??)

**Lagmuir waves** are  high frequency electron plasma waves.

**Electron Plasma Waves (EPW)** alson known as Langmuir wave??s, are electrostatic plasma waves with electrons as the oscillating species.

**Ion Acoustic Waves (IAW)** are low frequency electrostatic plasma waves, with ions as the oscillating species (the ions are responsible for the force that drive the wave). 
In this case the electrons fight to sustain charge neutrality.

**Electron temperature (Te)** is dependent on the velocity at which electrons travel within the plasma, since it is the KE of the electrons

**Electron density (ne)** is the number of free electrons per unit volume,and it is used to characterize the plasma.

**Gradient descent** is an optimization technique, which calculates the gradient of a function and moves in the decresing direction. This can help find the minimum value of a function. Although it is possible to be trapped in a local minima.
